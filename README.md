## Synopsis

This project implements Sudoku in several different programming languages <br />
(currently Java, C++, and Lisp). <br/>
Each implementation of Sudoku can: <br />
1.  Generate Sudoku puzzles: each puzzle will be written to its own text fileâ€¦ <br />
    a corresponding solution will also be written to its own text file <br />
2.  Solve Sudoku puzzles: the program can take in a text file that contains an unsolved Sudoku puzzle <br />
    and either create a file containing the solved puzzle or inform the user that the puzzle is unsolvable <br /> (see test_puzzle.txt for an example of how to format an input puzzle) <br />


## Running and Navigating Program

Please see the specific ReadMe.txt for the programming language implementation <br />
you wish to run (found in folder for that specific programming language)<br />


##Important Note##

While a Sudoku puzzle could potentially have multiple solutions, please note that
the solver implemented will just return ONE solution.
